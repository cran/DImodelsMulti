Single site dataset containing 48 experimental units (plots), with four species seeded at two
density levels, representing fifteen communities. One ecosystem function response is recorded for
each plot at a three time points.

    applied to the plot}
    \item{\code{G1}}{a numeric vector ranging from 0 to 1, the proportion of the species G1}

\details{
Data comes from a single site from a wider agrosdiversity experiment conducted in Belgium,
established in 2002. \cr
The four species used were Lolium perenne (G1), Phleum pratense (G2), Trifolium pratense (L1), and
Trifolium repens (L2). There are two recommended functional groupings: grouping grasses (G1, G2)
and legumes (L1, L2), or grouping fast-establishing species (G1, L1) and temporally persistent
species (G2, L2). \cr
One ecosystem function (aboveground biomass (t DM ha-1)) was recorded by summing recordings from
four harvests over each year, for three year.

# We fit a repeated measures DI model using the main function DImulti().
# We begin by passing the initial species proportions column names through 'prop' and the
# response value column name through 'y'.
# As the data contains multiple time points, we include the 'time' parameter, through which we
# specify the column name containing the repeated measure indicator and the autocorrelation
# structure we want to use, in this case, we use compound symmetry (CS).
# The experimental unit ID is stored in the column "PLOT" and so we pass this to 'unit_IDs'.
# We request that the method fits an average interaction structure and we include the treatments
# DENS and TREAT as additional fixed effects.
# We opt to use the ML estimation method to allow for model comparisons with different fixed
# effects.
# Finally, we specify the data object, dataSWE, through 'data'.
